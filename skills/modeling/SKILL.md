name: modeling
description: Use whenever the user wants to capture an idea, bug, feature request, refinement, or change to an existing bounded context — anything from "the button should be green" to "we need a whole new subscription subsystem". Also use when the user wants to refine existing backlog items or promote refined items to ready-to-work. Triggers on phrases like "I have an idea", "let's model this", "let's do some modeling", "capture this", "add this to the backlog", "refine the auth backlog", "promote X to todo", "we should also", "what if we added", "there's a bug", "change the color of", "the domain needs to handle". Creates task markdown files in the appropriate bounded context with the right status, and can spawn deeper modeling sessions via the orchestrator. Supports six switchable conversational modes (Interrogator [default], Suggestor, Challenger, Storyteller, Facilitator, Synthesizer) during CAPTURE and REFINE — see references/modes.md.

# Modeling — Capture, Refine, Promote, Dismiss

The `modeling` skill is the main entry point for the user's stream of ideas. Every thought — from a one-line bug to a cross-context architectural shift — enters the system here and ends up as a task file in a bounded context. It also owns the *removal* of a task that will never be worked (DISMISS), since the dashboard is read-only by design (ADR-0017) and all task-lifecycle changes belong to the skills.

## The four actions

Decide which action applies based on what the user said and the current state of `.agentheim/`:

| Action | When | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **CAPTURE** | User is describing something new | Turns the idea into one or more task files. Places them in `backlog/` if under-refined, or `todo/` if the idea is already concrete enough to work on. |
| **REFINE** | User wants to work through an existing backlog item, OR the user invoked model with no new idea and backlog items exist | Picks a backlog task, deepens it via the orchestrator, splits it if needed, updates acceptance criteria and dependencies. May move to `todo/` if it becomes ready. |
| **PROMOTE** | User explicitly wants a task ready for work | Moves a task from `backlog/` to `todo/`, verifying it has enough detail to be picked up by a worker. |
| **DISMISS** | User wants to drop a `backlog/`/`todo/` task that will never be worked — a stray capture, a duplicate, a since-abandoned idea | Hard-deletes the named task **and its entire transitive dependent subtree** under one confirmation, then reconciles all the bookkeeping (INDEX lines + counts, surviving backlinks, one protocol entry). Refuses if any task in the set is in `doing/` or `done/`. |

### Disambiguating intent

- If the user gives a concrete idea ("add dark mode") → CAPTURE directly. Don't make them wade through the backlog first when they already know what they want to add.
- If the user invoked `modeling` with **no concrete new idea** ("let's model", "let's do some modeling", "what's in the backlog?", or a bare invocation) → run the **Opening flow** below: show the backlog, offer to refine, fall through to capture.
- If the user says "promote X" / "X is ready" → PROMOTE
- If the user says "dismiss X" / "delete X" / "drop X" / "remove X" / "X is dead" / "we won't do X" → DISMISS (resolve X per "Identifying which task the user means", then run the DISMISS flow). DISMISS is also the verb the dashboard's per-card trash-can fires as `/agentheim:modeling dismiss <id>`.
- If ambiguous, ask once. Don't guess wrong and then have to undo. **Be especially careful before DISMISS** — it hard-deletes files (and possibly a whole subtree). Never infer DISMISS from a soft phrase; require an explicit drop/delete/dismiss intent or the literal command.

### Opening flow (bare invocation)

This runs only when the user opened `modeling` without handing you a concrete new idea — they want to work the backlog, or they haven't decided yet. The point is to surface what's already pending before inviting new thought, so existing ideas get refined instead of quietly accumulating.

1. **Gather the backlog.** After the "Before acting" reads, collect every task in `contexts/*/backlog/` across all BCs. Prefer the per-BC `INDEX.md` backlog lists (already loaded) over re-scanning directories.

2. **If the backlog is empty**, say so in one line and go straight to inviting a new idea (CAPTURE). Don't show an empty table.

3. **If the backlog has tasks, present them as a table** and ask whether the user wants to refine any before capturing something new. Use this shape:

   ```
   You have N items in the backlog:

   | ID        | Title                      | BC      | Type    | Age   |
   |-----------|----------------------------|---------|---------|-------|
   | auth-003  | Password reset flow        | auth    | feature | 12d   |
   | books-007 | Reading-session timeout    | books   | bug     | 3d    |

   Want to refine any of these before we capture something new? (give me an ID, or say "new" / "no" to capture instead)
   ```

   - Sort oldest-first (stalest items are the ones most worth surfacing), unless a task carries a priority flag.
   - "Age" is days since the `created` date relative to today; keep it compact ("3d", "2w"). Omit the column if `created` dates aren't available rather than guessing.
   - Keep it scannable. If the backlog is large (say >15), show the oldest 15 and note how many more exist ("…and 8 more — ask to see them or name one").

4. **Branch on the answer:**
   - User names a task (by id, number, or keyword) → **REFINE** that task (see REFINE flow; resolve the reference per "Identifying which task the user means").
   - User says "no" / "new" / "capture" / starts describing something fresh → **CAPTURE** (see CAPTURE flow).
   - User is vague → ask once which they meant; don't assume.

### Identifying which task the user means (REFINE / PROMOTE / DISMISS)

When the user references an existing task, support all of these:

- **Exact id** — `books-007` → that exact task
- **Numeric only** — `007` → find task with that number across all BCs; if multiple BCs have the same number, list them and ask
- **Keyword / fuzzy** — `password` or `reading session` → match substring (case-insensitive) against task `title` and filename across `backlog/` and `todo/` of all BCs
- **No argument** — list all backlog (and todo, for PROMOTE context) tasks grouped by BC and let the user pick

When there are multiple matches, show a compact summary (id, title, status, BC) and ask which one — don't silently pick the first.

DISMISS resolves its target by the exact same rules (exact id / number / keyword, list-on-ambiguity). It additionally scans `doing/` and `done/` while resolving so it can refuse early with a clear message when the named task is already in flight or shipped — only `backlog/` and `todo/` tasks are dismissable.

## Before acting

Read the current state:
1. `.agentheim/vision.md` (for context — if missing, offer to run `brainstorm` first)
2. `.agentheim/context-map.md` (if exists)
3. `.agentheim/contexts/*/README.md` (to know what BCs exist and their language)
4. `.agentheim/knowledge/index.md` (top-level catalog — current BCs, recent ADRs, global state) — if missing, the project hasn't been indexed; surface this and continue
5. `.agentheim/knowledge/protocol.md` — read the first ~100 lines (newest entries are on top, so this gives recent activity). Skip if it doesn't exist yet.
6. `.agentheim/contexts/*/backlog/*.md` (to understand what's pending)
7. **For CAPTURE only:** once you've identified the candidate BC, scan `.agentheim/contexts/<bc>/done/` for prior art on keywords/tags from the user's idea. See the "Prior art lookup" section.

If no bounded contexts exist yet, and the idea is non-trivial, propose running `brainstorm` first. Small ideas (bug fixes, copy changes) in a greenfield project can get a default `contexts/main/` until real structure emerges.

## Conversational modes

This skill adopts one of six modes during the conversational portions of **CAPTURE** and **REFINE**. The defaults differ by action:

- **CAPTURE defaults to Facilitator** — when the user (or a room) is volunteering a new idea, the scribe stance lets the human(s) drive while you capture and structure. Resist the urge to question or suggest until the idea has been articulated; CAPTURE is fundamentally about not getting in the way of incoming thought.
- **REFINE defaults to Interrogator** — refinement is where ambiguity gets cornered, so naive/critical questions are the right starting stance. The questioning patterns in the REFINE flow below are written for it.

The user can override the default at invocation ("capture this in challenger mode", "refine auth-003 as the storyteller") or switch mid-action ("switch to suggestor", "synthesize what we have"). Acknowledge a switch in one short line — e.g. `→ Suggestor.` — and continue.

If the user says "change mode" / "switch mode" / "show me the modes" without naming a target, present an arrow-key picker via `AskUserQuestion`. The picker contract lives in `references/modes.md` under "Picker" — four modes in the menu (Interrogator, Suggestor, Challenger, Storyteller); Facilitator and Synthesizer are typed via the auto-"Other" option.

Full mode definitions and switching protocol live in `references/modes.md`. The full set:

- **Interrogator** — naive/critical questions one at a time. REFINE default.
- **Suggestor** — make smart assumptions and proposals; user accepts/rejects/refines. Useful for tiny captures or stuck refinement.
- **Challenger** — adversarial skeptic, presses on weak acceptance criteria or shaky scope. Use sparingly.
- **Storyteller** — narrate concrete scenarios with named characters to surface acceptance criteria from lived behavior.
- **Facilitator** — scribe stance; minimal interjection, captures and structures what the room says. CAPTURE default.
- **Synthesizer** — reflect back tensions and emergent themes across the backlog or a refinement thread. Best as a periodic switch-into.

PROMOTE and DISMISS are mechanical (readiness check + file move; resolve + cascade + confirm + bookkeeping) and run the same regardless of mode. Task file format, ID conventions, the styleguide gate, protocol logging, and orchestrator handoffs are all mode-agnostic.

## CAPTURE flow

1. **Understand the idea.** If the user gave one sentence, ask follow-ups to get: the why, the acceptance criteria, anything that constrains the solution. Don't ask more than 3-4 questions. For tiny things ("change button color"), one question may be enough, or none.

2. **Route to the right bounded context.** Match the idea's language to a BC's ubiquitous language. If it spans multiple BCs, say so and create a task in each (or a parent+child structure — see below). If it doesn't fit any BC and isn't trivial, that's a signal the context map needs revisiting — surface it.

   **Infrastructure-flavored captures** (anything about runtime, hosting, persistence configuration, secrets, observability, CI/CD, deployment, shared transport, base library choice) get a sharper routing rule:

   - **Globally true** — the concern applies across every BC, or stands on its own independent of any single BC. *Examples:* "switch from npm to pnpm", "add OpenTelemetry tracing", "rotate the production database password", "upgrade the base container image". → Capture in `contexts/infrastructure/`.
   - **BC-local** — the concern is only true for one BC. *Examples:* "the Library BC needs full-text search via Postgres tsvector", "Transcription should retry failed jobs in its own queue", "Auth's session store should move to Redis (no other BC uses Redis)". → Capture in the originating BC.

   The test: *"if this BC didn't exist, would the change still need to happen?"* — if yes, it's globally true and lands in `infrastructure/`; if no, it's BC-local and stays in the originating BC. When in genuine doubt (the change might go cross-cutting later but starts BC-local), prefer the originating BC — moving a task up to `infrastructure/` later is cheaper than retroactively scoping out a global decision that turned out not to apply.

   **Do not spawn new infra-flavored BCs.** Captures that feel like they want their own `monitoring/`, `secrets/`, `deploy/` BC are global infra concerns — they go in `contexts/infrastructure/`, not a new BC. If a genuinely new BC seems warranted from an infra capture, surface it for a `brainstorm` extension session rather than letting `model` spawn it. The exception is `design-system/` — already a first-class BC for frontend infrastructure, and `model` may add tasks to it but does not create competing UI-infra BCs.

   If `contexts/infrastructure/` doesn't exist (e.g., `brainstorm` was skipped), surface that — offer to run `brainstorm` in extension mode to add the infrastructure BC, or create the BC explicitly with a minimal README before capturing the task.

3. **Prior-art lookup.** Run the matcher described in "Backlink lookup" below against the target BC's `INDEX.md` (ADRs, research, done tasks) and the top-level index (global ADRs, cross-BC research). Surface every match score ≥ 2 to the user *before* writing the task file. For each prior-art hit (done task), give the user three outcomes: "yes related", "not relevant", or "this is the same task — exit CAPTURE, REFINE that one instead". Skip this step for trivial captures (single-line copy changes, obvious bug fixes).

4. **Decide refinement level.**
   - **Under-refined → backlog/**: The idea needs more thought, research, or breaking down before anyone could work on it.
   - **Ready → todo/**: The idea is small, well-understood, or already deeply discussed. A worker could pick it up and execute without ambiguity.

5. **Delegate deep modeling if needed.** For complex ideas (new feature, domain change, architectural impact), spawn the **orchestrator** agent with the idea and current state. It will route to `tactical-modeler`, `strategic-modeler`, `architect`, or `researcher` as appropriate, and come back with a refined task (or task set) plus any ADRs. For infrastructure-flavored captures, the orchestrator will typically route to `architect` first.

6. **Write the task file(s).** Include the user-confirmed `related_adrs`, `related_research`, `prior_art` from step 3 in the frontmatter. See task format below.

7. **Commit the captured markdown** (after the index + protocol updates below). Scoped `git add` of just this capture's artifacts — the new task file(s), the BC `INDEX.md`, `protocol.md`, and any ADR the orchestrator wrote — then `chore(<bc>): capture <task-id> — <title> [<task-id>]`. See "Committing" below.

## REFINE flow

1. If no specific backlog item was named, list the backlog across all contexts and ask which to refine. Prefer oldest-first or user-priority if flagged.

2. Read the task, its BC's README, and any related tasks (dependencies, siblings).

3. **Interrogate the task.** Questions typically needed:
   - Is the goal still correct?
   - What are the acceptance criteria?
   - What does this depend on? What depends on it?
   - Does this split into smaller tasks?
   - Does this reveal a decision that should become an ADR?

4. **Delegate to the orchestrator** for depth. Give it the task and the BC context. It will route to specialists.

5. **Update the task file** with refined content. If it splits, create child tasks and update `depends_on`. If a decision was made, write an ADR to `.agentheim/knowledge/decisions/`.

6. **Promote if ready.** If refinement made the task ready, move it to `todo/`.

7. **Commit the refinement** (after the index + protocol updates below). Scoped `git add` of just the touched files — the refined task file (and any child task files if it split), the BC `INDEX.md`, `protocol.md`, and any ADR written — then `model(<bc>): refine <task-id> — <title> [<task-id>]` (one trailer per task if the refinement split into several). See "Committing" below.

## PROMOTE flow

1. Find the task (user may name it by id or title, or describe it).

2. Check readiness:
   - Has an acceptance criteria section with at least one concrete criterion
   - Has a clear scope (not "improve the UX")
   - Dependencies are known and either met or tracked

3. If ready, move the file from `backlog/` to `todo/`. Update its frontmatter `status` field.

4. If not ready, tell the user what's missing and offer to switch to the REFINE action on this task.

5. **Commit the promotion** (after the index + protocol updates below). Scoped `git add` of just the moved task file, the BC `INDEX.md`, and `protocol.md` — then `model(<bc>): promote <task-id> — <title> [<task-id>]`. See "Committing" below. (Nothing to commit if the task wasn't ready and stayed in `backlog/`.)

## DISMISS flow

DISMISS hard-deletes a task that will never be worked, **plus its entire transitive dependent subtree**, and then reconciles every record that pointed at the deleted ids. The contract is frozen by **ADR-0022** — follow it precisely. The disposition is a hard delete (no archive folder, no `status: dismissed` flag): these are unstarted ideas, little history is lost, and the protocol entry preserves the record that they were dropped.

The boundary mirrors ADR-0007: the raw `.md` deletes are the mechanical core; the skill owns the INDEX / protocol / backlink reconciliation layered around them. (DISMISS is a delete, not a move, so it does **not** call `applyTaskMove` — but it follows the same side-effect-ownership rule.)

1. **Resolve the named task** X (exact id / number / keyword — see "Identifying which task the user means"; list matches on ambiguity). Confirm X is in `backlog/` or `todo/`. **Refuse** with a clear message if X is in `doing/` or `done/` — you don't dismiss work in flight or shipped.

2. **Compute the cascade set.** Start with `{X}`. Repeatedly add every task T (in any BC) whose `depends_on` transitively contains a member of the set — equivalently, follow `blocks` edges forward — until the set stops growing (fixed point). This pulls in **upstream dependents only**: a task queued *behind* X, never a task X itself depends on.
   - **Only `depends_on`/`blocks` edges drive the cascade.** `prior_art`, `related_adrs`, and `related_tasks` are **not** traversed — references through those fields are *stripped* during bookkeeping (step 6), never followed to delete another task.
   - To find dependents cheaply, prefer the per-BC `INDEX.md` lists already loaded; scan task frontmatter (`depends_on`/`blocks`) across all BCs only as needed, since the subtree can span BCs.

3. **In-flight / shipped guard — refuse the whole operation.** If **any** member of the cascade set is in `doing/` or `done/`, abort before deleting anything and name the offending in-flight/shipped task. Cascade only ever deletes unstarted (`backlog`/`todo`) tasks; the builder resolves the in-flight edge by hand. (X itself being in `doing/`/`done/` is the same refusal from step 1.)

4. **Surface the full cascade set and confirm once.** Present the complete set — id + title for every task, grouped by BC, so the blast radius is visible — and take a **single** confirm/cancel. If the set is just `{X}`, say so plainly. **Cancel changes nothing on disk.** Never split this into per-task confirmations, and never delete more than the set you showed.

   ```
   Dismissing aw-046 will also remove every task queued behind it:

   | ID        | Title                                  | BC               | Status  |
   |-----------|----------------------------------------|------------------|---------|
   | aw-046    | Modeling DISMISS verb                  | agentic-workflow | backlog |
   | aw-048    | Dashboard per-card trash-can           | agentic-workflow | backlog |

   This hard-deletes 2 task files. Confirm? (yes / cancel)
   ```

5. **On confirm, hard-delete every `.md` file in the set** from disk.

6. **Reconcile bookkeeping for the whole set** (layered around the raw deletes):
   - **INDEX.md** — for each dismissed id, remove its line from its BC `INDEX.md` and decrement the matching Backlog/Todo count at the `<!-- task-counts:start -->` markers (no full-file rewrite — edit only at the markers, like every other index update). The set may span BCs, so **editing several BCs' `INDEX.md` in one DISMISS is legitimate here** — this is the one sanctioned exception to "don't edit the index across multiple BCs in one invocation".
   - **Surviving backlinks** — strip every dismissed id from any *surviving* task's `depends_on` / `blocks` / `prior_art`, and from any ADR's `related_tasks`. References *within* the set vanish with their files, so only survivors need editing — no dangling references left behind.
   - **Protocol** — prepend **one** bare `Modeling / Dismissed` entry to `.agentheim/knowledge/protocol.md` listing the whole cascade set (ids + titles). No builder-typed reason — id + title + timestamp is the record (see "Protocol logging").

7. **IDs are gone, never reused.** For new token ids this holds **by construction** (ADR-0028 §5): the generator emits a random token and never consults history, so a dismissed token is simply one of ~23M points the generator will, with overwhelming probability, never emit again — there is no counter to advance or rewind. For legacy `<bc>-NNN` ids the original rule is retained verbatim: a dismissed number is retired, consistent with "never renumber" — a future capture takes the next free number, never a dismissed one.

8. **Commit the dismissal** (ADR-0026). Scoped `git add` of exactly the files the cascade touched — the deleted task file paths (a delete is staged with `git add`/`git rm`), every `INDEX.md` the set spanned, every surviving task file or ADR whose backlinks were stripped, and `protocol.md` — then **one** commit for the whole cascade: `chore(<bc>): dismiss <id-or-cascade-set>` (name the lead id, or the set if small). **Never `git add -A`** — even though a DISMISS legitimately spans multiple BCs, the add stays an explicit enumeration of only the cascade's files, so a concurrent `work`/`modeling` session's in-flight markdown is never swept in (the scoped-add rule is load-bearing for concurrency, ADR-0026).

## Task file format

Files live as `contexts/<bc>/<status>/<id>-<slug>.md`. Example: `contexts/auth/backlog/auth-003-password-reset-flow.md`.

```markdown
---

## Why
Why this exists. The user problem or domain pressure behind it.

## What
What the change is, in domain language.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Concrete, testable outcomes.
- [ ] One bullet per criterion.

## Notes
Open questions, links to ADRs, references to research reports,
rough sketches — anything a worker or refiner would want.
```

Keep the frontmatter values clean — **no inline `# …` comments**. They are
trivial to leave in when filling the template, and the dashboard parses the whole
line as the value (a leaked comment on `status` once blanked the board). The
field legend lives here instead:

- `status` — one of `backlog | todo | doing | done` (also the lifecycle folder).
- `type` — one of `feature | bug | refactor | chore | spike | decision`.
- `completed` — left empty; the worker sets the date when the task is done. (There is no
  `commit:` field — ADR-0026 dropped it; a task's commit is found in `git log` via the
  `[<task-id>]` trailer the committing skill writes.)
- `depends_on` — list of task ids this one waits on; `blocks` is populated automatically by worker / refine.
- `related_adrs` — ADR ids (e.g. `[0007]`); auto-populated by model at capture/refine, orchestrator appends ADRs it writes.
- `related_research` — research slugs (e.g. `[auth-tokens-2026-04-24]`); auto-populated by model from the research index.
- `prior_art` — done task ids from the same BC matching keyword/tags; auto-populated by model at capture.

### ID convention

Emit a fresh id `<bc>-<token>`, where `<token>` is **exactly 5 characters** from the alphabet
`0123456789abcdefghjkmnpqrstvwxyz` (Crockford base32, lowercase, minus the look-alikes
`i l o u`); the **first character is a letter** (`[a-hjkmnp-tv-z]`), the remaining four are any
token character. Generate it randomly — **never scan existing files for a "next number".** See
ADR-0028 §1.

Example: `agentic-workflow-k3f9q`. Keep IDs stable — never renumber. With a random token this holds **by construction** (the generator never consults history). Legacy `<bc>-NNN` ids (e.g. `auth-003`) already on disk are kept as-is — never rewrite them.

## Decisions as tasks

When modeling surfaces a genuine architectural or domain decision that deserves its own treatment (rather than being an implementation detail of a feature), create a task with `type: decision`. Its output when worked is an ADR in `.agentheim/knowledge/decisions/`, not code. This lets decisions flow through the same backlog discipline as features.

## Frontend tasks: styleguide gate

If the project has a `contexts/design-system/` BC with a styleguide task (set up by `brainstorm`'s architecture foundation step), every captured frontend / UI task in any BC must include the styleguide task in its `depends_on`. Read the BC's README before capturing — frontend-bearing BCs carry a note that points at the styleguide task id.

If you're capturing the project's first frontend task and no styleguide task exists, **stop and surface that**. Offer either:
- Running `brainstorm` in extension mode to add the foundation step, or
- Capturing a `design-system-001-styleguide` task explicitly, with this captured task depending on it.

Never promote a frontend task to `todo/` ahead of the styleguide. The styleguide is reviewed with the user before any BC implements its UI — that's the gate.

## Delegating to the orchestrator

The `modeling` skill itself does not do deep modeling — it routes. For anything non-trivial, hand off to the `orchestrator` agent with:
- The idea or task being refined
- The target BC's README (ubiquitous language)
- The vision.md
- The context map
- A clear question: "refine this task" or "decompose this idea into tasks" or "tell me what BCs this touches"

The orchestrator picks specialists. Respect its output and integrate it into the task files.

## Research is fair game mid-model

If the user or the orchestrator hits an "we don't know enough about X" wall, kick off the `research` skill in parallel. Continue modeling what you can while research runs; fold its report into the task's Notes section when ready.

## Backlink lookup (auto-populate task frontmatter)

The point is to stop workers arriving in isolation. Whenever a task is being written or updated, pre-compute its backlinks so the worker doesn't have to re-derive them.

### When

- **CAPTURE** — after the BC is decided, before writing the task file.
- **REFINE** — after the orchestrator's specialist round, before writing the updated task file. Re-run from scratch each time (cheap; catches new ADRs/research that arrived since last refinement).

### Inputs

- The candidate task's `title`, `tags`, `What` body, and target BC.
- The target BC's `INDEX.md` (already loaded in "Before acting") — has the per-BC ADR list, research list, done-task list.
- The top-level `.agentheim/knowledge/index.md` — has the global ADR list and cross-BC research list.

### Matcher (cheap-first)

For each candidate artifact in the indexes:

1. **Slug overlap** — split the artifact's slug on `-` and the task's title on whitespace. Count words present in both (case-insensitive, ignore stopwords: `the / a / an / of / for / and / to / in / on`). Score = matches.
2. **Tag overlap** — if the artifact's source file has any of the task's `tags` in its frontmatter, +2 per shared tag.
3. **Threshold** — score ≥ 2 qualifies. Below that, do not auto-link.

Cap each list at 5 entries. If you have more than 5 candidates above threshold, take the highest-scored.

### What to populate

- `related_adrs`: ADR ids from (BC-scoped ADRs + global ADRs) that scored ≥ 2.
- `related_research`: research slugs from (BC-scoped + cross-BC research) that scored ≥ 2.
- `prior_art`: done task ids in the same BC that scored ≥ 2. (CAPTURE only — REFINE may already have human-curated prior_art; only add new entries, never remove.)

### Surface to user

For CAPTURE: before writing the task, show the user a one-line block per matched item ("Found prior art: auth-002 (Login session pinning, completed 2026-03-14). Read it?"). Three short outcomes the user can pick:

- "Yes, related" → keep in `prior_art` / `related_*`.
- "No, not relevant" → drop from the list.
- "This is the same — don't capture, update auth-002 instead" → exit CAPTURE, switch to REFINE on the prior task.

For tiny captures (single-line copy changes, trivial bug fixes), skip the matcher entirely. Don't burn context on lookups for `change button color`.

### Bidirectional link maintenance

When the orchestrator writes an ADR scoped to this task during REFINE:
1. Add the ADR id to `related_adrs` in the task frontmatter.
2. Add the task id to `related_tasks` in the ADR frontmatter.

When `work` records `ADRS_WRITTEN` for a SUCCESS task, do the same — append the ADR id to that task's `related_adrs` and update the ADR's `related_tasks`. (See `work/SKILL.md` "Index updates" — the bidirectional ADR↔task link maintenance lives in the same step.)

## Updating indexes

After writing or moving a task file, update the BC's `INDEX.md` so other skills (and you, on the next invocation) can find it without scanning directories. The template lives at `references/index-template.md`.

**Where to update:**

- **CAPTURE writing to `backlog/`:** insert under `<!-- backlog-list:start -->` in `contexts/<bc>/INDEX.md`. Increment Backlog count under `<!-- task-counts:start -->`.
- **CAPTURE writing directly to `todo/`:** insert under `<!-- todo-list:start -->`. Increment Todo count.
- **PROMOTE (backlog → todo):** remove the line from the backlog list, insert at the top of the todo list. Decrement Backlog, increment Todo.
- **REFINE that splits a task:** remove the parent line, insert child task lines. Update counts.
- **DISMISS:** for each id in the cascade set, remove its line from its BC `INDEX.md` and decrement the matching Backlog/Todo count at the markers. The set may span BCs — editing several BCs' indexes in one DISMISS is the sanctioned exception below.

If the BC's `INDEX.md` doesn't exist yet, create it from `references/index-template.md` with the BC name filled in. Do not invent sections — only the templated markers are append targets.

**What not to do:**
- Do not edit the index across multiple BCs in one skill invocation unless a single capture genuinely lands in multiple BCs, **or a DISMISS cascade set spans BCs** (ADR-0022 — the sanctioned exception).
- Do not auto-rewrite the entire file — only insert/remove at the markers. Preserve any human-added prose elsewhere.
- Do not append duplicate entries — if the line is already present (same task-id), skip.

If a brand-new BC is being created during CAPTURE (rare — model normally does not create BCs; that's brainstorm's job), also insert under `<!-- bc-list:start -->` in `.agentheim/knowledge/index.md`.

## Protocol logging

After each action — CAPTURE, REFINE, or PROMOTE — prepend an entry to `.agentheim/knowledge/protocol.md`. If `protocol.md` doesn't exist, create it with:

```markdown
# Protocol

Chronological log of everything that happens in this project.
Newest entries on top.

---
```

Then prepend the appropriate entry right after the `---` on line 4:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -- Modeling / Captured: <task-id> - [title]

**Type:** Modeling / Capture
**BC:** <bc-name>
**Filed to:** backlog | todo
**Summary:** [1-2 sentences on what the idea is]

---

## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -- Modeling / Refined: <task-id> - [title]

**Type:** Modeling / Refine
**BC:** <bc-name>
**Status after:** backlog | todo
**Summary:** [what was clarified, added, or split]
**Split into:** [list of new task ids, if split]
**ADRs written:** [list of ADR ids, if any]

---

## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -- Modeling / Promoted: <task-id> - [title]

**Type:** Modeling / Promote
**BC:** <bc-name>
**From → To:** backlog → todo

---

## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -- Modeling / Dismissed: <id-or-id-list>

**Type:** Modeling / Dismiss
**Dismissed:** [one line per task in the cascade set — `<task-id> - <title> (<bc>)`]

---
```

The DISMISS entry is **bare** — it records the cascade set (ids + titles) and the timestamp, no builder-typed reason. One entry per dismiss regardless of how many tasks the cascade removed.

If the action is non-trivial (multiple tasks created from one capture, refinement that produced ADRs, batch promotion), one entry per "thing the user asked for" is enough — don't prepend five entries for a single conversation turn.

## Committing

Each action — CAPTURE, REFINE, PROMOTE, DISMISS — commits its own markdown at the end of the action, so the working tree is clean afterward (ADR-0026). This is the same auto-commit discipline `work` and `quick-capture` follow: the skill that owns the bookkeeping owns the commit of that bookkeeping (ADR-0017).

**Scoped `git add` only — never `git add -A` / `git add .`.** `modeling` sometimes runs concurrently with a `work` session (and with `quick-capture`). Each action `git add`s an explicit, enumerated list of *only* the `.md` files it touched — the task file(s) it wrote or moved, the BC `INDEX.md`(es), `protocol.md`, and any ADR / vision / context-map it produced. A blanket add would sweep in a concurrent worker's un-verified code or another skill's in-flight markdown and bundle or race it into the wrong commit. This is load-bearing for concurrency safety, not a style choice (ADR-0026).

**Message convention** (the `[<task-id>]` trailer is the `git log` index — there is no `commit:` frontmatter field, ADR-0026 dropped it):

| Action | Message |
|---|---|
| CAPTURE | `chore(<bc>): capture <task-id> — <title> [<task-id>]` (one commit + trailer per task if a capture produced several) |
| REFINE | `model(<bc>): refine <task-id> — <title> [<task-id>]` (one trailer per task if it split) |
| PROMOTE | `model(<bc>): promote <task-id> — <title> [<task-id>]` |
| DISMISS | `chore(<bc>): dismiss <id-or-cascade-set>` (one commit for the whole cascade) |

`model` is a commit-message `<type>` prefix for modeling's markdown commits — it is **not** a task `type:` (those stay feature/bug/refactor/chore/spike/decision).

Commit **silently** — no confirmation prompt. The user's complaint that drove this doctrine was *leftover uncommitted* markdown; auto-committing the bookkeeping (and only the bookkeeping — never the builder's source code) is the fix, matching `work`. If the project isn't a git repo, skip the commit silently; the working-tree-clean guarantee only applies under git.

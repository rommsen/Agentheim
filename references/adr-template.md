# ADR 0007: Use Postgres as primary store for billing context

## Context
What forces this decision. What was true about the world that made
this question come up. Keep it factual.

## Decision
The decision in one or two sentences. What we are doing.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Things that get better / become possible.

### Negative
- Things that get worse / become harder. Name them honestly.

### Neutral
- Side effects that are neither good nor bad, but worth knowing.

## Alternatives considered
- **Alternative A** — why we didn't pick it, in one or two sentences.
- **Alternative B** — same.

## References
Links to research reports, external docs, prior ADRs.

## Writing guidance

- **Context is about forces, not solutions.** If you find yourself writing "we decided to" in the Context section, it belongs in Decision.
- **Name the negatives.** An ADR with only positives is either lying or underthought.
- **Cite alternatives even if they were obviously worse.** Future readers need to know you considered them.
- **Keep it short.** If an ADR is three pages, you're writing a design doc, not a decision record.

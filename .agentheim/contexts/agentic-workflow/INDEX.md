### Backlog
<!-- backlog-list:start -->
<!-- backlog-list:end -->

## ADRs scoped to this BC

<!-- adr-local:start -->
- **ADR-0027** — Advisory writes are distinct from lifecycle writes; the `whats-next` recommendation is an advisory write (`.agentheim/state/whats-next.md`, single-latest, git-ignored, read via `/api/doc`) (proposed) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0027-advisory-writes-distinct-from-lifecycle-writes.md`
- **ADR-0026** — Committing doctrine: every artifact-producing skill commits its own scoped `.md`; `work` folds bookkeeping into the task commit, `commit:` field dropped, trivial-squash carve-out (accepted) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0026-committing-doctrine-bookkeeping-in-task-commit.md`
- **ADR-0025** — The dashboard main pane gains a third view state (`mainView`) for built-in static pages, beside the task/document split; reshapes ADR-0021 (proposed) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0025-dashboard-main-pane-third-view-state-builtin-static-page.md`
- **ADR-0023** — The dashboard's `/api/search` is the read-only server's first content-search endpoint — pure corpus walk, title-first ranking, body excerpts (proposed) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0023-dashboard-search-read-endpoint.md`
- **ADR-0022** — DISMISS cascades the whole dependent subtree; refuses if it touches doing/ or done/ (proposed) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0022-dismiss-cascades-dependent-subtree.md`
- **ADR-0021** — The dashboard open-intent splits on artifact kind: tasks → slide-over, non-task documents → main pane (accepted; reshapes ADR-0010 & ADR-0011 §5) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0021-open-intent-split-task-slide-over-doc-main-pane.md`
- **ADR-0020** — Board prompt-bar confetti is a board-local transient ACK, not a styleguide motion primitive (accepted) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0020-board-confetti-board-local-transient-ack.md`
- **ADR-0019** — Armed skip-permissions launch reuses the existing `--obligation` token as its danger hue, unforked (accepted) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0019-dashboard-armed-launch-danger-token.md`
- **ADR-0001** — Dashboard write-semantics — Promote-only UI moves, one shared mover, optimistic concurrency (superseded by ADR-0017) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0001-dashboard-write-semantics.md`
- **ADR-0017** — Dashboard is read-only; skills are the sole owners of task lifecycle (accepted) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0017-dashboard-read-only-skills-own-lifecycle.md`
- **ADR-0004** — Detached dashboard server uses a neutral cwd and AGENTHEIM_ROOT, not the project dir (proposed) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0004-dashboard-detached-process-cwd.md`
- **ADR-0007** — applyTaskMove owns only the move; INDEX/protocol side-effects stay with skills (proposed) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0007-task-move-side-effect-boundary.md`
- **ADR-0009** — Dashboard frontend app lives in `dashboard/app/`, consumes the styleguide; build retargets to it (proposed) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0009-dashboard-frontend-app-shell.md`
- **ADR-0010** — The dashboard slide-over feeds the styleguide Drawer a doc-shaped item (accepted) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0010-slide-over-doc-shaped-item.md`
- **ADR-0011** — The dashboard library/navigation surface is the non-task half of the tree projection, grouped client-side (accepted) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0011-dashboard-library-groups-from-tree-locations.md`
- **ADR-0012** — applyTaskMove resolves slugged task filenames from a bare id; the SSE consumer re-fetches, never interprets (proposed) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0012-applytaskmove-resolves-slugged-filenames-by-bare-id.md`
- **ADR-0015** — Board per-column view-state (group + sort + collapse) persists in versioned `localStorage` (proposed) — `../../knowledge/decisions/0015-board-view-state-persisted-localstorage.md`

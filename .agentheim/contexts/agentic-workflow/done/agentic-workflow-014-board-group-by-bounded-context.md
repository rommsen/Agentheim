## Why
The board is **flat by design** (ADR-0009): every BC's tasks pool into the four
lifecycle columns, each card carrying its BC only as a `context` chip. That reads fine
with a handful of cards, but as more bounded contexts land, a column becomes an
undifferentiated pile — you can't see, at a glance, *how much of `done` is
infrastructure vs design-system*, or scan one BC's work in isolation. Grouping by
bounded context restores that per-BC legibility **without** abandoning the flat board:
it's an optional, per-column **view lens** over the same read model, exactly as
column-sort (agentic-workflow-012) is. The board stays a pure projection of disk; only
the presentation reshapes.

## What
Next to each column's existing sort `<select>` (agentic-workflow-012), add a per-column
**group-by-BC toggle**. When a column is grouped:

- Its tickets are partitioned by `context` (BC) into labeled, **collapsible** sections —
  each section header shows the BC name and a card count.
- Cards **within** a section still obey that column's current sort (the pipeline becomes
  project → sort → group; grouping never re-sorts).
- Sections are ordered by BC name ascending (stable, legible); a BC with zero cards in
  that column shows no section (no empty headers).

The toggle is **per-column** (group `done` by BC while leaving `todo` flat is legal),
mirroring the per-column independence of sort.

**Persistence (reverses ADR-0009's "no localStorage" clause):** the grouped/flat choice,
each column's sort choice, and each `(column, BC)` collapse state survive a reload via a
single versioned `localStorage` view-state store. This applies to the **existing column
sort too** — flipping it from in-session-only to persisted is in scope. On every SSE
`tree-changed` re-projection (and on reconnect), the stored view-state is re-applied, not
reset — same guarantee sort already gives in-session. A brand-new BC, or a column with no
stored state, defaults to **flat + sort-default + all-expanded**.

This is **board-side view-state only** — a new pure, unit-tested grouping transform
(`dashboard/app/board-group.js`, sibling to `board-sort.js`, run *after* sort) plus the
persistence store. It never mutates the read model, the tree projection, or disk. No new
server endpoint; `applyTaskMove` and the read API are untouched.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Each board column renders a group-by-BC toggle as a sibling of its sort control
      (consuming the styleguide `ColumnHeader`/`kanban.js` unmodified, per ADR-0003 — the
      `DragColumn`/board-`<select>` precedent).
- [ ] Toggling group **on** for a column partitions its cards into per-BC sections, each
      with a header showing BC name + card count; toggling **off** restores the flat,
      sorted list with no visual residue.
- [ ] Each BC section is independently collapsible; collapsing hides its cards and the
      header shows the collapsed state + retains the count.
- [ ] Cards within a section honor the column's current sort order; changing the sort
      while grouped re-sorts within every section without ungrouping.
- [ ] Sections are ordered by BC name ascending; a BC with zero cards in that column
      renders no section.
- [ ] The toggle is per-column and independent: grouping one column does not group the
      others.
- [ ] Grouped/flat choice, sort choice, and per-`(column, BC)` collapse state persist
      across a full page reload via a single versioned `localStorage` store; the existing
      column-sort choice now persists too (previously in-session-only).
- [ ] On an SSE `tree-changed` re-projection and on EventSource reconnect, the persisted
      view-state is re-applied (group/sort/collapse all preserved), never reset.
- [ ] A new BC appearing in the tree, or a column with no stored state, defaults to flat +
      default sort + all sections expanded — never `NaN`, never a throw.
- [ ] `dashboard/app/board-group.js` is a pure function of (sorted tickets, grouping-on,
      collapse-state), unit-tested under `node --test`, run after `board-sort.js`; it does
      not mutate `treeToColumns` output, the read model, or disk.
- [ ] The collapsible section header reuses the styleguide's existing collapsible
      primitive (the one `TreeGroup` uses for the library) if it fits; only if it
      genuinely does not, a board-local section matching styleguide tokens is acceptable
      (sort-`<select>` precedent) **and** a `design-system` capture is filed for the
      missing shared component.
- [ ] An ADR-0009 addendum records the view-state-persistence reversal (grouping + sort +
      collapse now `localStorage`-backed; board remains a projection of disk).
- [ ] Full dashboard test suite stays green.

## Notes
- **Decided in refinement (2026-06-09, Interrogator):** per-column toggle; collapsible BC
  sections (not contiguous runs); persist across reloads — and persist the existing
  column-sort too.
- **ADR amendment, not a silent flip.** ADR-0009 says "in-session view-state only — no
  localStorage, so every load resets to the default." This task deliberately reverses that
  for sort + grouping + collapse. Worker writes the addendum (cf. infrastructure-010's
  ADR-0002 addendum pattern). The board stays a *projection of disk*; persistence is
  view-state only, never a second source of lifecycle truth.
- **Amends agentic-workflow-012.** The sort feature's "in-session view-state only, no
  `localStorage`" behavior is intentionally changed here. aw-012 is `done` and not
  reopened; this task supersedes that one clause of its behavior and the README's
  "Column sort" entry should be updated to match.
- **Styleguide gate / open component question.** Whether the collapsible section header
  warrants a *new shared styleguide component* is left to the worker to settle during TDD
  against the design-system. Preferred: reuse the `TreeGroup` collapsible primitive.
  Fallback: board-local, token-matched, plus a `design-system` capture. The board-`<select>`
  sort precedent makes a board-local control defensible.
- **Render pipeline order:** project (`treeToColumns`) → sort (`board-sort.js`) → group
  (`board-group.js`). Grouping consumes already-sorted output; it never re-orders cards
  beyond partitioning, so sort semantics (name/mod-date, id tie-break, null-mtime-oldest)
  are preserved inside each section.
- **Possible split (not taken):** the sort-persistence flip could be its own task, but it
  shares the single `localStorage` view-state store this task introduces, so splitting
  would create an artificial store-first dependency. Kept as one coherent commit:
  "persisted per-column view-state, with collapsible BC grouping." Revisit if the worker
  finds the store substantial enough to land first.

## Outcome
Each dashboard board column now carries an independent **group-by-bounded-context**
toggle as a sibling of its sort `<select>` (the `DragColumn` / board-`<select>`
precedent; styleguide `kanban.js` consumed unmodified, ADR-0003). Toggling a column
on partitions its cards into per-BC sections — header = BC name + card count,
ordered by BC name ascending, no section for a BC with zero cards — each
independently **collapsible** (collapse hides cards, retains count). Cards within a
section keep the column's current sort: the render pipeline is project
(`treeToColumns`) → sort (`board-sort.js`) → **group (`board-group.js`)**; grouping
only partitions, never re-orders.

The partitioning is a pure, DOM-free transform `dashboard/app/board-group.js`
(`groupTickets(sorted, { grouped, collapsed })` → ordered sections), unit-tested
(`dashboard/test/board-group.test.mjs`, 12 tests). It never mutates the transform,
read model, or disk.

**View-state persistence (reverses ADR-0009's "no localStorage", supersedes
aw-012's in-session-only sort):** grouped/flat, sort, and each `(column, BC)`
collapse state now persist in one **versioned** `localStorage` store
(`dashboard/app/board-view-state.js`, key `agentheim.board.viewState`,
`VIEW_STATE_VERSION = 1`), unit-tested (`dashboard/test/board-view-state.test.mjs`,
8 tests). It is pure over an injected backend; a stale-version / malformed / absent
blob degrades to "every column defaults" (flat + default sort + all-expanded) —
never `NaN`, never a throw, never a blank board. Persistence is presentation-only:
content stays a projection of disk, re-fetched on every SSE frame, so a live
re-projection re-applies (never resets) the lens. The reversal is recorded in
**ADR-0015** (addendum to ADR-0009).

The board React glue lives in `dashboard/app/board.js` (`ColumnGroupToggle`,
`ColumnControls`, board-local `BCSectionHeader`, grouped/flat rendering in
`DragColumn`, unified per-column `view` state seeded from + persisted to the store).
The collapsible section header is **board-local**, token-matched: the styleguide
`TreeGroup` primitive is coupled to `TreeItem` rows and owns its own open state, so
it does not fit a board section rendering draggable `TicketCard`s with
externally-persisted collapse state. A `design-system` capture
(**design-system-005**) is filed for the shared collapsible primitive.

Bundle rebuilt (`dashboard/dist/`). Full dashboard suite green: **171 tests pass**
(20 new). Key files: `dashboard/app/board-group.js`,
`dashboard/app/board-view-state.js`, `dashboard/app/board.js`,
`dashboard/test/board-group.test.mjs`, `dashboard/test/board-view-state.test.mjs`,
`dashboard/dist/app.js`, ADR-0015, README *Column grouping* / *Persisted board
view-state* sections.

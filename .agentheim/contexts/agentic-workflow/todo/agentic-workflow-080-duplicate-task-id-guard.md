## Why

ADR-0028's random-token scheme is collision-free by construction at the realistic concurrent
window (≈0.005% over n≈50), but a tiny residual collision probability remains, and a token can
also clash with a legacy id only through a bug. ADR-0028 names a duplicate-id check as the
**insurance** that covers that tail (rather than a longer token). It also backstops ADR-0022's
"ids are retired, never reused" and ADR-0012's anchored id→file resolution: two files claiming
one id silently corrupts `depends_on` / `blocks` / `prior_art` edges, the `[<id>]` commit
trailer, and dismiss/retirement — exactly the failure ADR-0028 §Context warns about. This task
is explicitly **optional / not required for v1** of the id scheme.

**Refinement finding (this repo has no CI).** The original capture called this a "CI lint" and
its acceptance asked for "CI wiring". There is **no CI pipeline in this repo** — no `.github/`,
no GitHub Actions, no root `package.json`. The repo's actual guard convention is a **pure,
stdlib-only module under `lib/` unit-tested with `node --test`** (the `task-lifecycle.mjs` ↔
`lib/test/task-lifecycle.test.mjs` pairing, and the `tree.mjs` / `search.mjs` "pure core,
DOM-free, loss-tolerant, `node --test`-able" doctrine). So the guard is delivered as a
`node --test` check, **not** a CI job; "passes on the current tree" becomes a live-tree
assertion in that suite. If a CI pipeline is ever introduced, it runs the same suite — no
rework. This reframe stays within ADR-0028's "optional duplicate-id check" clause; the ratified
token grammar (§1–§3) is **not** re-litigated here.

## What

Add a pure scanner module that enumerates every task file under
`.agentheim/contexts/*/{backlog,todo,doing,done}/` across all BCs, collects each task's `id`,
and reports any id that appears in more than one file. Cover it with a `node --test` test that
both (a) exercises the scanner against fixtures and (b) runs it against the **live** `.agentheim/`
tree and asserts there are no duplicates — the recurring insurance.

Shape it like the existing pure modules: stdlib-only, DOM-free, side-effect-free (takes a root
path, returns data), so it is trivially `node --test`-able and could later be invoked from a
release preflight or a CI job without change.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A pure scanner (e.g. `lib/duplicate-id-check.mjs`, exporting something like
      `findDuplicateTaskIds(root)`) walks all four lifecycle folders of every BC and collects
      each task's id. It is stdlib-only and side-effect-free (root in → data out), mirroring
      `lib/task-lifecycle.mjs` / `dashboard/tree.mjs`.
- [ ] The id is taken from the task's frontmatter `id`, falling back to the filename's `<id>-`
      prefix when frontmatter is absent/malformed (disk is the source of truth — the scanner is
      loss-tolerant and never throws on a single bad file, matching the tree-walk doctrine).
- [ ] For any id appearing in more than one file, the scanner returns the offending id **and all
      colliding file paths**; a thin reporter renders a clear failure message naming them.
- [ ] Shape-agnostic — legacy `<bc>-NNN` and new `<bc>-<token>` ids are compared as **whole ids**
      (no tail parsing, no id/slug split), so the guard is independent of the ADR-0028 grammar and
      of aw-078's `deriveContext` change.
- [ ] A `node --test` test (e.g. `lib/test/duplicate-id-check.test.mjs`) covers: two files sharing
      one id → reported with both paths; all-distinct ids → empty; a mixed legacy+token tree → still
      compared whole-id.
- [ ] The same test runs the scanner against the **live** `.agentheim/` tree and asserts **no
      duplicates** (this replaces the original "passes on the current tree" + "CI wiring" criteria;
      the `node --test` suite is the gate, since the repo has no CI).
- [ ] No CI pipeline is introduced (none exists). The guard is exercised by the existing
      `node --test` suite the maintainer / `release` skill runs.

## Notes

- Insurance only; do **not** gate the id-scheme rollout on this task (ADR-0028).
- **Independent of aw-078 / aw-079** by design — whole-id comparison means it needs neither the
  `deriveContext` dual-shape regex nor the minting sweep. `depends_on: []` is intentional; it can
  be worked anytime (before or after the rest of the ADR-0028 children).
- Keep it cheap — an O(tree) walk into a `Map<id, paths[]>`, flagging entries with >1 path;
  lifecycle folders are small.
- Natural future invocation point: the `release` skill's preflight (RELEASE.md) could call the
  scanner before tagging — out of scope here, but the side-effect-free shape leaves it open.
- Promotion-ready after this refinement, but parked in `backlog/` deliberately because it is
  explicitly optional insurance — promote when the builder wants it built.

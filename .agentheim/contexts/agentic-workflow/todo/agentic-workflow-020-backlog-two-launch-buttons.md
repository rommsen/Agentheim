## Why
Today the backlog add-ticket affordance only **copies** a `/agentheim:modeling`
command to the clipboard (aw-016); the builder then switches to the terminal and
pastes. The builder wants the board to *start the work directly* — and to offer the
two real entry points into the backlog: a fast jot vs. a full modeling session. So
the single "Add ticket" affordance becomes **two buttons**:

- **Quick Capture** → starts `/agentheim:quick-capture` (the fast idea-dump skill,
  renamed in aw-019).
- **Modeling** → starts `/agentheim:modeling` (the full Socratic session).

Each should open a real, interactive Claude session seeded with the command, via the
VS Code bridge (infrastructure-012) — `claude "/agentheim:quick-capture"` /
`claude "/agentheim:modeling"`.

## What
Replace the backlog column's single add affordance with a Quick Capture / Modeling
button pair, wired to launch through the bridge, with a clipboard fallback:

1. **Two-button affordance** in the backlog column (header add-slot and/or the empty
   backlog state). Needs a styleguide button-pair treatment consumed unforked
   (ADR-0003) — may spawn a design-system child task during refine.
2. **Launch via bridge:** each button does a `fetch()` POST to the
   infrastructure-012 listener with its prompt, opening a seeded interactive terminal.
3. **Clipboard fallback (builder's explicit requirement):** if the page is **not**
   running in the VS Code Simple Browser, or the bridge listener is unreachable, the
   buttons fall back to today's behavior — copy the corresponding command to the
   clipboard with the same quiet "copied" feedback. The board must never surface an
   error for an absent bridge; absence is a normal mode, not a failure.

The board stays a projection of disk (ADR-0001): launching a session is an external
side-effect, not a lifecycle write.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The backlog add affordance renders **two** labelled buttons, "Quick Capture" and "Modeling" (replacing the single add-ticket affordance); todo/doing/done are unaffected (their affordances were removed in aw-018).
- [ ] When the bridge is available, **Quick Capture** opens an interactive terminal running `claude "/agentheim:quick-capture"` and **Modeling** runs `claude "/agentheim:modeling"`.
- [ ] When the page is not in VS Code's Simple Browser **or** the bridge is unreachable, each button falls back to copying its command (`/agentheim:quick-capture` / `/agentheim:modeling`) to the clipboard, with the existing quiet "copied" feedback and the existing no-throw clipboard guard (aw-016).
- [ ] Bridge-unavailable is detected gracefully (timeout / connection-refused / not-in-Simple-Browser) and silently degrades to clipboard — no error toast, no console crash, no broken-looking button.
- [ ] The exact launched/copied command strings are produced by pure, unit-tested logic (extends `modeling-command.js`; add the quick-capture command) under `node --test`.
- [ ] The button pair is consumed from the styleguide unforked (ADR-0003); the board does not fork the primitive.
- [ ] The dashboard `dist/` is rebuilt so the served bundle carries the change.

## Notes
- **Depends on:** infrastructure-012 (ADR-0018 — the frozen bridge contract: port,
  token, `bridge.json`, the absence-detection probe), infrastructure-014 (the
  dashboard `GET /api/bridge` endpoint this frontend fetches to discover the bridge),
  aw-019 (so the Quick Capture command is `/agentheim:quick-capture`), and
  design-system-001 (styleguide gate; frontend). It does **not** depend on
  infrastructure-013 (the extension `.vsix`): an absent extension is a normal, tested
  mode for the frontend (clipboard fallback), so this can ship before the extension exists.
- Evolves aw-016 (`prior_art`): reuses its `copyToClipboard` no-throw guard and its
  pure command-builder as the **fallback** path; the new primary path is the bridge.
- Bridge-detection contract (port, token, how the frontend probes presence) is owned
  by infrastructure-012's ADR — refine this task after that contract is pinned.
- Open for refine: exact placement of the two buttons (header add-slot vs. the empty
  backlog card vs. both), and whether the per-card backlog copy button (aw-016) stays
  as-is or also gains a launch path. Research backing the launch mechanism:
  `knowledge/research/vscode-dashboard-terminal-bridge-2026-06-09.md`.

## Why

ADR-0028 replaces the sequential-integer task id with a `<bc>-<token>` shape (5-char random
token, leading letter) while keeping legacy `<bc>-NNN` ids go-forward. The one code change the
ADR identifies is `deriveContext` in `lib/task-lifecycle.mjs`: its current `/^(.*)-\d+/` only
recognises an all-digit tail, so a new token-tailed id (`agentic-workflow-k3f9q`) would derive
the wrong BC (or fall through to returning the whole id). `resolveTaskFile` needs no change —
ADR-0012's trailing-`-` anchor already handles both shapes — but it wants a test to lock that in.

This is the smallest implementation slice of ADR-0028 and ships first; it is what every other
new-id behavior depends on.

## What

Update `deriveContext(id)` in `lib/task-lifecycle.mjs` to derive the correct BC for **both**
id shapes, end-anchored on the bare id, per ADR-0028 §4. Add tests covering both shapes for
`deriveContext` and a `resolveTaskFile` resolution test for a token-tailed id.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `deriveContext('agentic-workflow-077')` returns `agentic-workflow` (legacy, unchanged).
- [ ] `deriveContext('agentic-workflow-k3f9q')` returns `agentic-workflow` (new token shape).
- [ ] The replacement regex is dual-shape and end-anchored, e.g.
      `/^(.*)-(?:\d+|[a-hjkmnp-tv-z][0-9a-hjkmnp-tv-z]{4})$/`, using `m[1]` as the BC. A token with a
      leading digit must NOT be treated as a token (it would be ambiguous with legacy); a
      legacy all-digit tail must still derive the BC.
- [ ] `resolveTaskFile` resolves a token-tailed `<id>-<slug>.md` file via its existing
      trailing-`-` anchor with no code change — covered by a new test that creates a fixture
      file `agentic-workflow-k3f9q-some-slug.md` and asserts it resolves from the bare id.
- [ ] No legacy id behavior regresses: existing `deriveContext` / `resolveTaskFile` tests stay
      green.
- [ ] No id rewrite, no migration — go-forward coexistence (ADR-0028).

## Notes

- Touch point: `lib/task-lifecycle.mjs`, `deriveContext` (~line 240) only. `resolveTaskFile`
  (~line 64) is unchanged but gains a token-shape test.
- Grammar and disambiguation tell are fixed by ADR-0028 §1–§3; do not re-litigate them here —
  this task implements the ratified grammar.

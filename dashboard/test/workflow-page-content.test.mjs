// Static guard for the Workflow guide page's real three-segment layout + caption
// copy (agentic-workflow-059, governed by ADR-0003 / ADR-0017 / ADR-0025).
//
// aw-058 landed the routing scaffold with a PLACEHOLDER WorkflowPage body; this
// task replaces that body with the real static page: three named segments in
// order (Preparation → Capturing → Promote & Work), each a labelled section with
// honest, skill-accurate caption copy and an empty, clearly-marked placeholder
// diagram slot (aw-060 fills the diagrams). The page is static / built-in (no
// /api/doc fetch), read-only (ADR-0017), styleguide tokens consumed unforked
// (ADR-0003), and keeps the main-pane reader's centered reading measure
// (maxWidth 760, margin "0 auto" — aw-040).
//
// The board's React glue has no DOM render harness in this project; the established
// idiom (aw-026 / aw-027 / aw-039 / aw-058) is source-reading static guards. This
// suite follows it, asserting against the WorkflowPage function source.

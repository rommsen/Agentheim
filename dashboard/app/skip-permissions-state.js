/* ============================================================
   Agentheim — dashboard persisted SKIP-PERMISSIONS "armed" toggle
   (agentic-workflow-021)

   The dashboard's bridge launch buttons start a real, interactive `claude`
   session. When this setting is ARMED, every bridge launch requests a
   skip-permissions session — the bridge then seeds
   `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "<prompt>"` (the opt-in contract frozen
   in infrastructure-015 / honoured in infrastructure-016, amended ADR-0018).

   This module is the dashboard-side STATE behind that control — WHETHER the
   bypass is armed, and how it is remembered. It is a SIBLING of theme-state.js
   (aw-017) and board-view-state.js (aw-014 / ADR-0015) and deliberately mirrors
   their shape: a single versioned localStorage key with safe degradation.

   The ONE rule that sets this store apart from its siblings: the bypass must
   NEVER be silently on. So the default is OFF, and EVERY degraded path —
   malformed JSON, a stale version, an absent blob, a non-boolean value, no
   backend, a throwing backend — resolves to OFF (armed=false), never a throw and
   never on. Only an explicit, current-version, boolean-`true` blob arms it.

   Like its siblings, this is presentation view-state ONLY — it never records
   lifecycle truth, so the dashboard stays read-only over .agentheim/ (ADR-0017 /
   ADR-0001) and the armed choice survives every SSE re-projection of /api/tree
   untouched. The store is pure over an INJECTED storage backend, framework-free,
   and never throws. Unit-tested under `node --test` with no DOM.

 * A no-op when there is no backend (SSR / no DOM). Storage write failures (quota,
 * disabled) are swallowed — a failed PREFERENCE write must never surface as a

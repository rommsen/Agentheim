/* ============================================================
   Agentheim — dashboard board data transform (agentic-workflow-006)

   The pure, framework-free bridge between the read projection
   (/api/tree, aw-005) and the approved styleguide Kanban
   components (design-system-001/002). Given the tree JSON it
   pools every bounded context's tasks into the four FLAT lifecycle
   columns (no swimlanes — the per-card BC chip tells contexts
   apart, per the aw-006 decision) and maps each tree task into the
   shape the styleguide `TicketCard` renders.

   Kept in its own module (no React, no htm) so it is unit-testable
   under `node --test` without a DOM, and so the React board shell
   stays thin. The styleguide source is the single source of UI
   truth (ADR-0003); this transform shapes DATA for it, it does not
   restyle or fork any component.

 * Normalize any task status into one of the four canonical lifecycle values.
 * Disk is the source of truth, but a hand-edited task file can carry a malformed
 * status (e.g. a leaked frontmatter-template comment: `todo  # backlog | …`). The
 * styleguide `TicketCard` indexes a fixed STATUSES registry by this value and
 * reads `.color` off the result — an unrecognized key would be `undefined` and
 * throw AT RENDER TIME, unmounting the whole React root (a blank board). So the
 * board never lets a non-canonical status reach the card: an unknown status is
 * bucketed into `backlog`, matching where `columnFor` places the same task. One
 * bad task file can no longer crash the board.

 * read model deliberately omits those (pointers/metadata only, ADR-0002), so we
 * supply quiet, defined placeholders rather than letting the card show
 * `undefined`. `path` is carried through unchanged — the slide-over (aw-007)
 * uses it to fetch the body via /api/doc; the open-intent emitted on click

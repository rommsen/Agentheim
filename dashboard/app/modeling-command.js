/* ============================================================
   Agentheim — dashboard modeling-command string builders (agentic-workflow-016,
   extended by aw-020 and aw-022)

   Pure, framework-free builders for the exact Claude Code command strings the
   board's backlog affordances launch (VS Code bridge, ADR-0018) — and copy to the
   clipboard on the bridge-absent fallback. The board stays a projection of disk
   (ADR-0001) — these add no lifecycle write, only the launch/clipboard
   side-effect; each string is a pure function of the ticket id.

   No React, no htm, no DOM, no clipboard, so they are unit-testable under
   `node --test`, mirroring board-sort.js / board-data.js. The React wiring (the
   cornerAction buttons + the column launch pair) and the window.fetch / clipboard
   side-effects live in board.js / bridge-launch.js as integration glue around this.

   The command text is the FULLY-QUALIFIED `/agentheim:modeling` (confirmed with
   the builder, aw-016), NOT the bare `/modeling` alias, so the launch/paste
   resolves regardless of the builder's alias setup.

   - Backlog COLUMN affordance (aw-020): the bare `/agentheim:modeling`
     (MODELING_COMMAND) and `/agentheim:quick-capture` (QUICK_CAPTURE_COMMAND).
   - Backlog CARD affordance (aw-022): a per-card Refine / Promote pair — an
     EXPLICIT-VERB command per the card's id: `refineCommandFor(id)` →
     `/agentheim:modeling refine <id>` and `promoteCommandFor(id)` →
     `/agentheim:modeling promote <id>`. The verbs are explicit on purpose
     (builder decision, 2026-06-14): they read unambiguously to the `modeling`
     skill's REFINE / PROMOTE routing and stay symmetric, rather than relying on a
     bare-id implicit refine.

// The fully-qualified, bare modeling command — what the backlog add-ticket `+`
// copies, and the prefix every per-card command shares.
export const MODELING_COMMAND = '/agentheim:modeling';

// The fully-qualified quick-capture command (agentic-workflow-020) — the fast
// idea-dump skill, renamed to `/agentheim:quick-capture` in aw-019. The backlog
// add affordance is now TWO launch buttons (Quick Capture / Modeling); this is
// the exact prompt the Quick Capture button hands to the bridge's POST /run (the
// extension wraps it as `claude "<prompt>"`, ADR-0018) and the exact text it
// copies to the clipboard on the bridge-absent fallback path. Bare and
// fully-qualified for the same reason MODELING_COMMAND is — it resolves
// regardless of the builder's alias setup.
export const QUICK_CAPTURE_COMMAND = '/agentheim:quick-capture';

// The fully-qualified research command (agentic-workflow-036) — the board prompt
// bar's third launch button (beside Quick Capture / Modeling) hands this exact
// string to the bridge's POST /run (the extension wraps it as `claude "<prompt>"`,
// ADR-0018) and copies the same on the bridge-absent fallback. Like the other two
// authoring buttons it CONSUMES the typed prompt (researchCommandFor), so the bare
// constant is the empty-prompt fallback only. Bare and fully-qualified for the same
// reason MODELING_COMMAND is — it resolves regardless of the builder's alias setup.
export const RESEARCH_COMMAND = '/agentheim:research';

// The fully-qualified inquire command (agentic-workflow-h7n2c) — the board prompt
// bar's fourth launch button (between Modeling and Research) hands this exact string
// to the bridge's POST /run (the extension wraps it as `claude "<prompt>"`, ADR-0018)
// and copies the same on the bridge-absent fallback. Like the other authoring buttons
// it CONSUMES the typed prompt (inquireCommandFor), so the bare constant is the
// empty-prompt fallback only. The `inquire` skill answers questions toward the codebase
// (read-only over `.agentheim/` and the source, ADR-0017). Bare and fully-qualified for
// the same reason MODELING_COMMAND is — it resolves regardless of the builder's alias setup.
export const INQUIRE_COMMAND = '/agentheim:inquire';

// The fully-qualified, bare WORK command (agentic-workflow-024) — what the board
// prompt bar's right-side action column launches to kick off an EXECUTION run
// against the ready backlog. Unlike Quick Capture / Modeling (authoring actions that
// consume the typed prompt), Work IGNORES the textarea and always launches this bare
// command, so it is a plain constant rather than a `*CommandFor(prompt)` builder.
// Bare and fully-qualified for the same reason MODELING_COMMAND is — it resolves
// regardless of the builder's alias setup (ADR-0018 launch / clipboard fallback).
export const WORK_COMMAND = '/agentheim:work';

// The fully-qualified, bare WHAT'S-NEXT command (agentic-workflow-064 button,
// agentic-workflow-069 swap) — what the main-column topbar's standing "What's next"
// button (between the gear and Work) launches to get a concise overview of the most
// sensible next steps. It invokes the `whats-next` skill (skills/whats-next/SKILL.md):
// read-only over `.agentheim/` (reads vision / boards / protocol / open questions,
// recommends the next step, never moves or commits — ADR-0017). Like WORK_COMMAND it
// IGNORES the prompt-bar textarea, so it is a plain constant rather than a
// `*CommandFor(prompt)` builder. Bare and fully-qualified for the same reason the others
// are — it resolves regardless of the builder's alias setup (ADR-0018 launch / clipboard
// fallback; the extension wraps a slash command the same way it wraps any prompt).
export const WHATS_NEXT_COMMAND = '/agentheim:whats-next';

// The fully-qualified, bare DASHBOARD-STOP command (agentic-workflow-028) — what the
// main-column topbar's quiet "Stop dashboard" button launches to stop the running
// dashboard server FROM the UI it is already looking at. It REUSES the existing bridge
// launch path (launchOrCopy): the spawned session runs `/dashboard stop` →
// stopDashboard(root) (kill pid + remove runfile, aw-011), so the dashboard server is
// never asked to stop itself — server.mjs stays purely read-only (ADR-0017; the seam
// decision is bridge-reuse, not a new self-stop endpoint). Like WORK_COMMAND it IGNORES
// the prompt-bar textarea, so it is a plain constant rather than a `*CommandFor(prompt)`
// builder. Bare and fully-qualified for the same reason the others are — it resolves
// regardless of the builder's alias setup (ADR-0018 launch / clipboard fallback).
